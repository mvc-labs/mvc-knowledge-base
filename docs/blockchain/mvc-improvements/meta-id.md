# MetaId Web3 Identity

Introduction to the MetaId identity protocol.

[MetaID](https://docs.metaid.io/) is a unified identity and data format protocol built on Bitcoin and its isomorphic blockchains (such as MVC). Based on the MetaID protocol, developers can create various Web3 applications on Bitcoin, where data is owned by the user.

## Uses of MetaID

In simple terms, MetaID can be used to:

- Build all types of Web3 applications on Bitcoin and MVC, including social applications, games, e-commerce applications, etc.
- Issue various FT and NFT assets closely tied to data value on Bitcoin and MVC.

## Features of MetaID

- Abstracts discrete blockchain data into an ordered tree structure, preparing it for building Web3 applications on Bitcoin.
- All user information and application data are on-chain, stored at addresses corresponding to user-controlled private keys, ensuring data ownership solely by the data creator.
- Each piece of MetaID on-chain data is inherently a non-fungible token (NFT) data, allowing users to freely transfer and trade it, giving users complete control over their data.
- Data can be interconnected across different applications, eliminating data silos between applications. Different protocol data can be combined under a user's MetaID, significantly reducing Web3 application development efforts.

## Vision of MetaID

Bitcoin, with its high consensus, high concurrency, and support for on-chain data storage, is the best carrier for Web3 applications. MetaID aims to become the largest unified protocol for user identity and data in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

MetaID will create a new Web3 development paradigm where data is interconnected, owned by users, and naturally combined with user data and assets. We believe Bitcoin = Money + Data.

## Basic Principles of MetaID

Through the MetaID protocol, transactions based on MetaID scattered on the blockchain are fully categorized into a tree structure based on "people". From the perspective of the MetaID protocol, all on-chain data is abstracted and stored on-chain in the format of a "MetaID tree". Thus, data can be independent of the chain and even independent of the envelope format storing the data. As long as the resulting "MetaID tree" conforms to the MetaID format, it can achieve user-owned data, orderly data storage, and data interoperability. Therefore, all forms of Web3 applications can be built on this foundation.
