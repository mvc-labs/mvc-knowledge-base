# Introduction to sCrypt Language

Introducing the programming language sCrypt for MVC contracts.

> Note: The latest version of the sCrypt language has adopted TypeScript as its underlying language. Therefore, the
> syntax of the sCrypt language is similar to that of TypeScript. The TypeScript version is currently being integrated
> into MVC, and the knowledge base will be updated according to the development progress of the new SDK.

sCrypt (pronounced "ess crypt") is a high-level smart contract language designed for the Bitcoin Virtual Machine.
Bitcoin supports writing smart contracts using a Forth-like stack-based Script language. However, writing smart
contracts in native Script is both cumbersome and error-prone. As the size and complexity of contracts increase, these
issues become increasingly difficult to manage.

sCrypt aims to simplify the process of writing smart contracts that run on-chain.

It is easy to learn. Syntactically, sCrypt is similar to JavaScript and Solidity, making it more accessible and easier
to use for existing web and smart contract developers.

It is statically typed. Type checking can detect many errors at compile time.
